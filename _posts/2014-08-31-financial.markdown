## Week 1

Some conception:

* FV: Future Value
* PV: Present Value
* r : discount rate
* n : number of period 
* pmt(payment) : the amount of each payment in case of an annuity
* NPV : Net Present Value
* IRR : Internal Rate of Return

---

## Week 2

Some formulae to help you understand the relationship between time and money.

- Future Value of a Stream of Cash Flows as of n Periods from Now
$$ FV = C\_1 * (1+r)^{n-1} + C\_2 * (1+r)^{n-2} + ... + C\_n $$
- Present Value of a Stream of Cash Flows
$$PV = \frac{C\_1}{1+r} + \frac{C\_2}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{C\_n}{(1+r)^n}$$

## Week 3

Calculate IRR : Refer to PV formulae, find out 'r' that let PV = 0.

Calculate NPV : Equals calculate PV.

Decision criteria:

* NPV
* IRR
* ?
